Linkin Park are one of the most popular bands of the so called \"nü-metal\" movement, along with Limp Bizkit, Korn and several others. Their sound is a wide range of influences, including metal, alternate rock, hip-hop, electronica and industrial. Linkin Park's debut album \"Hybrid Theory\" was a multi-platinum smash worldwide, selling over 30 million copies, 12 million of them in the US alone. Reanimation is the correspondent remix album. Formed as Xero (5) in the winter of 1995/96, the band was renamed to Hybrid Theory in 1999. They were signed as a developing artist to Warner Bros. Records in late 1999, but the label advised them to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid, a popular House music group. Looking for a new name, Hybrid Theory briefly considered \"Lotus Foundation Project\" and \"Plear\", before settling on \"Linkin Park\" in May 2000. This name was suggested by Chester Bennington after seeing a street sign for the park named \"Lincoln Park\" in Los Angeles. The spelling was changed to \"Linkin Park\" to acquire the internet domain \"linkinpark.com\". Frontman Chester Bennington died from suicide on July 20, 2017."

By the time they released their debut full-length Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 in 1997, the name had been shortened to HIM to make their name easier on the Finnish tongue as well as to tone down the more occult elements of their public image. With their second album, Razorblade Romance, HIM gained exposure all over Europe as the track \"Join Me\" was included in the European version of the movie The Thirteenth Floor. Their fourth album, Love Metal, expanded their popularity to the U.S., giving them the status of world-wide rock stars. The album Dark Light spawned the hit \"Wings of a Butterfly\", which became the band's biggest US hit and made Dark Light the first album by a Finnish act to go gold in the US. The band disbanded in 2017."
